# rust-affected

A GitHub Action that detects which packages in a Rust workspace are affected by a set of changed files, using the Cargo dependency graph.

Given a set of changed files, it determines:
- **`changed_crates`** — packages with files directly modified
- **`affected_library_members`** — pure library crates that are changed or (transitively) depend on a changed crate; binary crates are excluded from this list
- **`affected_binary_members`** — affected crates that have a binary target; mutually exclusive with `affected_library_members`
- **`force_all`** — whether a configured force-trigger file changed, meaning the entire workspace should be considered affected

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      affected_binary_members: ${{ steps.affected.outputs.affected_binary_members }}
      force_all: ${{ steps.affected.outputs.force_all }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Get changed files
        id: changed
        uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v47

      - name: Detect affected packages
        id: affected
        uses: robertrautenbach/rust-affected@v4.0.3
        with:
          changed_files: ${{ steps.changed.outputs.all_changed_files }}
          force_triggers: |
            Cargo.lock
            Cargo.toml
            rust-toolchain.toml
            .cargo/config.toml
            .github/

  deploy:
    needs: plan
    if: contains(needs.plan.outputs.affected_binary_members, 'my-service') || needs.plan.outputs.force_all == 'true'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying my-service"
```

## Example output

Imagine a workspace where `lib-utils` is a shared library depended on by `lib-core`, `lib-core-ext`, `app-alpha`, `app-beta`, and `tool-alpha`. A PR that changes `lib-utils/src/lib.rs` produces:

```
changed_crates=["lib-utils"]
affected_library_members=["lib-core","lib-core-ext","lib-utils"]
affected_binary_members=["app-alpha","app-beta","tool-alpha"]
force_all=false
```

The action also writes a job summary to the workflow run:

> ## rust-affected
>
> | | Crates |
> |---|---|
> | **Changed** | `lib-utils` |
> | **Affected libraries** | `lib-core` `lib-core-ext` `lib-utils` |
> | **Affected binaries** | `app-alpha` `app-beta` `tool-alpha` |
>
> ### Changed crates

## Getting changed files

You provide the list of changed files — here are common approaches:

### tj-actions/changed-files

```yaml
- name: Get changed files
  id: changed
  uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v47

- uses: robertrautenbach/rust-affected@v4.0.3
  with:
    changed_files: ${{ steps.changed.outputs.all_changed_files }}
```

### git diff (no extra dependencies)

```yaml
- name: Get changed files
  id: changed
  run: |
    echo "files=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}..HEAD | tr '\n' ' ')" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

- uses: robertrautenbach/rust-affected@v4.0.3
  with:
    changed_files: ${{ steps.changed.outputs.files }}
```

> **Note:** Requires `fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout` so the base SHA is available locally.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `changed_files` | **Yes** | Space- or newline-separated list of changed file paths relative to the workspace root. |
| `force_triggers` | No | Space- or newline-separated list of glob patterns that trigger a full rebuild when any matching file changes. Supports `*`, `**`, and `?`. A bare name (e.g. `Cargo.lock`) matches that exact path only. A trailing slash (e.g. `.github/`) matches the directory and everything inside it. Full globs are also supported (e.g. `**/*.sql`, `migrations/**`). If omitted, `force_all` is never set. |
| `excluded_members` | No | Space- or newline-separated list of workspace member names **or path prefixes** to exclude from all outputs. A plain name (e.g. `my-tool`) matches the crate name directly. An entry containing `/` is matched against the crate's directory relative to the workspace root: a trailing slash (e.g. `tools/`) excludes every crate under that directory, while an exact relative path (e.g. `tools/my-tool`) excludes only that crate. Useful for internal tooling or helper crates that should never appear in CI results. If omitted, no members are excluded. |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `changed_crates` | JSON array of crate names with directly changed files |
| `affected_library_members` | JSON array of affected workspace members that are pure library crates (no binary target) |
| `affected_binary_members` | JSON array of affected workspace members that have a binary target; mutually exclusive with `affected_library_members` |
| `force_all` | `"true"` if a force-trigger file changed, otherwise `"false"` |

## Migrating from v3

v4 is a breaking change. The action no longer detects changed files itself — you provide them via the `changed_files` input.

| v3 | v4 |
|---|---|
| `base_sha` input (optional) | Removed — compute your own diff |
| Changed files detected automatically | `changed_files` input (**required**) |
| All outputs | Unchanged |

**Before (v3):**
```yaml
- uses: robertrautenbach/rust-affected@v4.0.3
```

**After (v4):**
```yaml
- name: Get changed files
  id: changed
  uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v47

- uses: robertrautenbach/rust-affected@v4.0.3
  with:
    changed_files: ${{ steps.changed.outputs.all_changed_files }}
```
